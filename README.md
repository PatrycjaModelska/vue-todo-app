# TODO app

## Project info

This is my start with creating a frontend in Vue. 
I learned a lot from two great tutorials which I can recommended for beginners:
#### https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-fundamentals
#### https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1

The app is like a sandbox where I could try how Vue works. I tried learn how to:
- use router
- fetch data
- create new components
- use build-in directives

App uses external API source:
